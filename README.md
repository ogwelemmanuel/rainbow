**Shows a simple rainbow animation**

This program continuously prints the same rainbow pattern. What changes
is the number of space characters printed to the left of it. Increasing this
number moves the rainbow to the right, and decreasing it moves the rain-
bow to the left. The indent variable keeps track of the number of spaces.
The indentIncreasing variable is set to True to note that indent should increase
until it reaches 60, at which point it changes to False. The rest of the code
decreases the number of spaces. Once it reaches 0, it changes back to True
again to repeat the zigzag of the rainbow
